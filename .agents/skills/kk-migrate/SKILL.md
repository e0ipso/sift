description: Run any pending knowledge-base migration by querying the deterministic migration chain (`migrate status`) and executing each pending step's documented procedure in-host, with every write delegated to the step's deterministic CLI primitives. Use when the node reader, `doctor`, or `init` reports an out-of-date `schema_version` / legacy flat layout and asks you to migrate, or when the user asks to migrate the knowledge base.

# kk-migrate

You are the migrator — for **any** pending knowledge-base migration, not one specific hop. The knowledge base stores its on-disk layout at a numbered `schema_version`, and each registered migration step takes the tree from one version to the next. Read the shared constraints and handoff below before executing the ordered step procedures.

## Resolve the project root

Resolve the repo root (the directory containing `.ai/kenkeep`) with the shipped detector, then treat the printed path as the working directory for every command below:

```bash
KK_REPO_ROOT=$(node .ai/kenkeep/scripts/kk-detect-root.mjs) || exit $?
cd "$KK_REPO_ROOT" || exit $?
pwd
```

## Dispatch

Before anything else, ask the CLI which migrations are pending:

```bash
npx --yes kenkeep@latest migrate status
```

- If it prints a line like `Knowledge base is already at schema_version 3; nothing to do.` (or `No knowledge base found under nodes/; nothing to do.`), there is nothing to migrate. **Stop** and report that one line to the user. Do nothing else.
- Otherwise stdout is exactly one JSON line — the ordered chain of pending steps:

  ```
  {"current":2,"target":3,"steps":[{"id":"okf-v3","from":2,"to":3,"primitives":["migrate okf-v3"]}]}
  ```

  `current` is the detected on-disk schema version, `target` is the version this CLI ships, and `steps` is every step needed to bridge the gap, in execution order. Each entry carries the step's stable `id`, the `from`/`to` versions it bridges, and the deterministic CLI `primitives` it drives.

For each `steps[]` entry, **in order**, find the procedure section below whose heading carries that exact `id` and execute it. If no section in this document matches a step's `id`, **stop and report to the user** that this copy of the skill predates the registered step: the CLI knows a migration this skill copy cannot yet perform, so the skill must be upgraded (re-run `init --upgrade`) before migrating. Never improvise a procedure for an unknown step id.

## Shared constraints and handoff

These rules apply to every migration step. Step sections add only their inputs, commands, result details, and step-specific validation failures.

- **In-host only.** Exercise every judgment call in this interactive session. There is no sub-agent, runner, `-p` spawn, or headless full-migration path.
- **Honor deterministic validation.** Pass every complete plan to the documented primitive and fix any rejection before proceeding. Every leaf keeps its exact id and edges; never submit a plan that invents, renames, drops, merges, or omits one. A primitive's pre-mutation validation failure leaves the knowledge base unchanged.
- **Use deterministic mutation only.** Every knowledge-base write goes through the step's documented CLI primitive. You may author the temporary JSON document a primitive consumes, but never write, relocate, or rebuild node files and indexes yourself.
- **Leave git to the user.** Never invoke git yourself. Leave the migration as an uncommitted diff, tell the user that no git command was run, and ask them to review with `git diff`. The user accepts with `git commit` and rejects with a path-scoped or whole-tree `git restore`.

## flat-to-tree (1 -> 2)

Migrates a v1 knowledge base — leaves stored in a flat `nodes/practice/` and `nodes/map/` layout — to the v2 nested topical folder tree. The one judgment call is clustering the flat leaves into topical folders; every write goes through the `place apply` primitive.

### 1. Get the inventory

Run the deterministic inventory primitive and capture stdout:

```bash
npx --yes kenkeep@latest place inventory
```

Dispatch already established this step is due, so expect exactly one JSON line. (If the primitive short-circuits or refuses instead — the tree changed since dispatch — stop and report its output to the user.)

```
{"leaves":[{"id":"<id>","title":"...","kind":"practice|map","tags":["..."],"summary":"...","relates_to":["..."],"sourcePath":"..."}, ...]}
```

This is your input. The primitive read and validated the frontmatter for you — cluster this JSON; never open or parse the leaf files yourself.

### 2. Cluster the leaves in-session

Group the leaves from the inventory into a small set of topical folders. Apply these rules:

- **Topical folders, small set.** Group related leaves into a small set of topical folders. A folder name is lowercase and dash-separated, and may nest with `/` (e.g. `cli`, `knowledge-base/index`). Do not create a folder per leaf; cluster.
- **Keep cross-referencing nodes close.** Leaves that reference each other (via `relates_to`) generally belong near each other.
- **Preserve every id exactly.** Following the shared id-and-edge rule, give every inventory leaf one placement under the `id` the inventory supplied. The folder is presentation only.
- **Author one `summary` per created folder.** For each distinct folder you use, write a one-line `summary`: a noun phrase / sentence fragment that completes "for more information on &lt;summary&gt;" (lowercase start, no trailing period, ≤ ~140 chars). Name what lives in the folder, then append a short `; read when <task pattern>` clause naming the tasks that should trigger descent — agents route by matching their task against these summaries, so the trigger clause is what makes descent reliable.

Assemble the placement-and-folders document. It must match the exact shape `place apply` parses:

```json
{
  "placements": [{ "id": "<leaf-id>", "targetFolder": "<folder>" }],
  "folders": [{ "folder": "<folder>", "summary": "<fragment>" }]
}
```

One placement for **every** leaf in the inventory, and one `folders` entry for **every** distinct `targetFolder` you used. (A leaf you want to leave at the `nodes/` root takes `"targetFolder": ""` and needs no `folders` entry for the empty root.)

**Surface the proposed grouping to the user for review** before applying: show the folder tree and which ids land in each folder, plus each folder's authored summary. This is a one-shot, high-impact reorganization of the whole KB — let the user steer it before any write.

### 3. Apply the placement deterministically

Write your document to a tmpfile and hand it to the deterministic apply primitive:

```bash
PLACE_PLAN=$(mktemp -t kk-place-plan.XXXXXX.json)
# Write your {"placements":[...],"folders":[...]} document to $PLACE_PLAN.
npx --yes kenkeep@latest place apply --input "$PLACE_PLAN"
```

The primitive validates every id against the leaves actually on disk and every authored folder summary against the folders the placements create — **before any write** — then relocates each leaf with its id and bytes preserved (only `schema_version` bumps) and stamps each folder summary into the folder-summary sidecar. A bad plan (an unknown/omitted id, or a summary keyed to a folder no leaf is placed into) aborts with a clear message and makes **zero** filesystem changes; fix the document and re-run under the shared validation and mutation rules.

On success it prints one JSON line, the placement summary:

```
{"placed":[{"id":"<id>","targetFolder":"<folder>"}, ...]}
```

### 4. Rebuild the indices

Regenerate `ENTRY.md`, `GRAPH.md`, and every folder `index.md` from the relocated tree:

```bash
npx --yes kenkeep@latest index rebuild
```

The rebuild self-preserves the folder summaries you stamped in step 3. A folder you left without an authored summary renders the Title-cased folder-name fallback; `index rebuild` warns and exits zero (warn, never block).

### 5. Hand off

Use the standard no-git review handoff above. Add these migration results: leaves moved into their topical folders show as renames (ids and bytes preserved); each created folder's authored summary is recorded in `.ai/kenkeep/FOLDER_SUMMARIES.md`; `ENTRY.md` / `GRAPH.md` are refreshed.

## okf-v3 (2 -> 3)

Migrates a v2 topical tree to the v3 OKF-native node format. This step is fully deterministic: there is no clustering and no LLM judgment. Your role is to invoke the primitive, inspect its summary, and hand the resulting diff to the user for review.

### 1. Run the deterministic rewrite

Run the primitive reported by dispatch:

```bash
npx --yes kenkeep@latest migrate okf-v3
```

It refuses unless the detected on-disk version is exactly `2`. On success it mechanically:

- renames leaf frontmatter `kind` -> `type` and `summary` -> `description`;
- moves kenkeep-owned fields to `kk_` extension keys (`kk_schema_version`, `kk_id`, `kk_relates_to`, `kk_depends_on`, `kk_derived_from`, `kk_confidence`);
- renders the generated `Related` and `# Citations` body sections from the v3 frontmatter truth;
- migrates folder summaries out of old `nodes/**/index.md` frontmatter into `.ai/kenkeep/FOLDER_SUMMARIES.md`;
- rebuilds `nodes/**/index.md`, `ENTRY.md`, and `GRAPH.md`.

It prints one JSON line:

```json
{"converted":2,"folder_summaries":1,"collisions":[]}
```

If `collisions` is non-empty, surface it clearly: those leaves already had an unmarked `# Related` or `# Citations` heading before the generated sections were appended. Do not try to merge the headings yourself; the user reviews the body diff.

### 2. Verify and hand off

Run the normal deterministic checks:

```bash
npx --yes kenkeep@latest lint --verbose
npx --yes kenkeep@latest doctor --verbose
```

Use the standard no-git review handoff above. Add these migration results: leaves are rewritten in place, folder summaries now live in `.ai/kenkeep/FOLDER_SUMMARIES.md`, ordinary `nodes/**/index.md` files are OKF reserved files, and `ENTRY.md` / `GRAPH.md` are refreshed.
