# kenkeep Index: convention

↑ Parent: [kenkeep](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**Do not add AI attribution trailers to commit messages**](practice-do-not-add-ai-attribution-trailers-to-commit-messages.md) to learn about: Commit messages carry no Co-Authored-By or similar AI attribution trailers. #git #commits #convention

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**The test suite runs README's recipes, not copies of them**](map-sift-test-suite-runs-the-readme-recipes-themselves.md) to learn about: tests/run.sh is the whole verification story: no framework, cookbook cases extract the fenced blocks from README.md and run that text. #testing #portability #shell #convention #sift
- Open [**Sift: an AI-first issue tracker that lives in the working tree**](map-sift-file-based-issue-tracker.md) to learn about: Sift's entire state is markdown files on disk; there is no database, daemon, or CLI, and git is the audit log. #sift #architecture #convention

## By topic

### #convention
- Open [**Never write data through a sed replacement text**](../portability/practice-never-write-data-through-a-sed-replacement-text.md) — sed re-scans the replacement for & and \\1, so a title like "caching & sharding" comes back mangled; concatenate in awk instead.
- Open [**Neutralise grep's no-match status with \`|| \[ $? -eq 1 \]\`, never \`|| true\`**](../practice-neutralise-greps-no-match-status-with-exit-code-1-not-true.md) — grep exits 1 for 'nothing selected' and 2 for a real error; absorb only the 1, or an audit reports clean on a tree it half read.
- Open [**Guard an unmatched glob with a -d/-f test, never nullglob**](../practice-guard-an-unmatched-glob-with-a-d-test-never-nullglob.md) — A glob matching nothing stays literal, so a for-loop runs once for the pattern; test the entry inside the loop, not shopt.
### #sift
- Open [**Never write data through a sed replacement text**](../portability/practice-never-write-data-through-a-sed-replacement-text.md) — sed re-scans the replacement for & and \\1, so a title like "caching & sharding" comes back mangled; concatenate in awk instead.
- Open [**Neutralise grep's no-match status with \`|| \[ $? -eq 1 \]\`, never \`|| true\`**](../practice-neutralise-greps-no-match-status-with-exit-code-1-not-true.md) — grep exits 1 for 'nothing selected' and 2 for a real error; absorb only the 1, or an audit reports clean on a tree it half read.
- Open [**Guard an unmatched glob with a -d/-f test, never nullglob**](../practice-guard-an-unmatched-glob-with-a-d-test-never-nullglob.md) — A glob matching nothing stays literal, so a for-loop runs once for the pattern; test the entry inside the loop, not shopt.
### #architecture
- Open [**Sift: an AI-first issue tracker that lives in the working tree**](map-sift-file-based-issue-tracker.md) — Sift's entire state is markdown files on disk; there is no database, daemon, or CLI, and git is the audit log.
### #commits
- Open [**Do not add AI attribution trailers to commit messages**](practice-do-not-add-ai-attribution-trailers-to-commit-messages.md) — Commit messages carry no Co-Authored-By or similar AI attribution trailers.
### #git
- Open [**Nothing leaves the machine during a sift drain**](../sift-drain/practice-never-push-or-file-upstream-during-a-drain.md) — No agent runs git push and none touches an external tracker; an upstream fix worth making becomes a local type: dx ticket.
- Open [**Account for .ai/sift being gitignored**](../sift-drain/practice-account-for-ai-sift-being-gitignored.md) — Ignore-aware search silently skips the tracker and it has no diff, so use find plus command grep and re-read ROADMAP.md before every dispatch.
- Open [**Fresh sift trees ignore themselves via .ai/sift/.gitignore**](../sift-init/practice-fresh-sift-trees-ignore-themselves-via-ai-sift-gitignore.md) — On first mkdir, write * / !.gitignore inside .ai/sift; never edit the repo root .gitignore; do not restore a deleted stub on repair.
### #portability
- Open [**Neutralise grep's no-match status with \`|| \[ $? -eq 1 \]\`, never \`|| true\`**](../practice-neutralise-greps-no-match-status-with-exit-code-1-not-true.md) — grep exits 1 for 'nothing selected' and 2 for a real error; absorb only the 1, or an audit reports clean on a tree it half read.
- Open [**Guard an unmatched glob with a -d/-f test, never nullglob**](../practice-guard-an-unmatched-glob-with-a-d-test-never-nullglob.md) — A glob matching nothing stays literal, so a for-loop runs once for the pattern; test the entry inside the loop, not shopt.
- Open [**Never write data through a sed replacement text**](../portability/practice-never-write-data-through-a-sed-replacement-text.md) — sed re-scans the replacement for & and \\1, so a title like "caching & sharding" comes back mangled; concatenate in awk instead.
### #shell
- Open [**Neutralise grep's no-match status with \`|| \[ $? -eq 1 \]\`, never \`|| true\`**](../practice-neutralise-greps-no-match-status-with-exit-code-1-not-true.md) — grep exits 1 for 'nothing selected' and 2 for a real error; absorb only the 1, or an audit reports clean on a tree it half read.
- Open [**Guard an unmatched glob with a -d/-f test, never nullglob**](../practice-guard-an-unmatched-glob-with-a-d-test-never-nullglob.md) — A glob matching nothing stays literal, so a for-loop runs once for the pattern; test the entry inside the loop, not shopt.
- Open [**Never write data through a sed replacement text**](../portability/practice-never-write-data-through-a-sed-replacement-text.md) — sed re-scans the replacement for & and \\1, so a title like "caching & sharding" comes back mangled; concatenate in awk instead.
### #testing
- Open [**tree_digest cannot see an empty directory**](../practice-tree-digest-cannot-see-an-empty-directory.md) — The harness digest hashes files only, so a tree-untouched assertion needs an explicit assert_no_dir for any directory the failing path could create.
- Open [**Prove a rewrite left the rest of the file alone with diff**](../practice-prove-a-rewrite-left-the-rest-of-the-file-alone-with-diff.md) — A test for a script that rewrites a shared file asserts diff reports zero deletions; re-reading the added row cannot see a rewrite above it.
- Open [**The collated-range scan targets globs, not every bracket in the text**](../practice-the-collated-range-scan-targets-globs-not-usage-strings.md) — portability.test.sh's range ban excludes regex-tool lines and \[--long-option\] usage strings on purpose; a single leading hyphen stays covered.
