# kenkeep Index: spec

↑ Parent: [kenkeep](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**Treat README.md edits as public-API changes**](practice-treat-sift-spec-edits-as-api-changes.md) to learn about: Layout and front-matter are the API: state the migration, keep every cookbook command runnable, and keep the spec repository-agnostic. #sift #convention #docs

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**README.md is the normative sift spec; AGENTS.md governs changing it**](map-sift-readme-normative-spec.md) to learn about: README.md ships into consuming repos as .ai/sift/README.md and fixes the convention; AGENTS.md holds the bar for editing it. #sift #convention #docs

## By topic

### #convention
- Open [**Never renumber, reuse, or delete a ticket ID**](../tickets/practice-never-renumber-or-reuse-a-ticket-id.md) — Ticket IDs are immutable and globally unique across both buckets; a wrong ticket is archived as wontfix, never removed.
- Open [**Sift ticket bodies: four canonical sections plus type extensions**](../tickets/map-sift-ticket-body-sections.md) — Problem, Evidence, Direction, Acceptance criteria — extended for type: bug and type: feature; headings are parsed by agents.
- Open [**Keep tickets atomic and evidence-based, drafted against the type's schema**](../tickets/practice-write-atomic-evidence-based-tickets.md) — One file is one ticket, claims about code cite file:line, and non-trivial tickets are drafted into a scratch XSD-shaped file first.
### #docs
