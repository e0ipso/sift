# Drain Sift

Work the backlog wave by wave. Assign related tickets to worker sittings, land their
commits and tracker updates, and complete each wave gate before continuing.

## Gate: is sift initialized?

Run `sift-init`'s `scripts/sift-gate.sh` first. Use its resolved root and exit code:

- **0 (`READY`)**. Continue below.
- **3 (`UNINITIALIZED`)**. Hand off to `sift-init`; initialize without asking.
- **4 (`UNINITIALIZED`)**. Hand off to `sift-init`; report the resolved path and ask
  before initialization.
- **6 (`INCOMPLETE`)**. Hand off to `sift-init`; repair without asking.
- **5 (`UNRESOLVED`)**. No project root found. Report the `$PWD` it walked from and stop.

`tests/static/gate-handoff-contract.test.sh` checks these handoffs.

## Orchestrate, never implement

Workers implement product code and tests. You prepare their workspaces, land commits,
archive tickets and assign follow-up waves. Delegate merge conflicts too.

Read wave-status output, every remaining ticket in the current wave, worker reports and
archived resolution lines needed for gate coverage. Derive write scope from ticket
citations. Send source, diff and raw test-output questions to workers.

Never push or write to an external tracker. Reserve an ID and file upstream proposals
locally as `type: dx` for the user.

## Scripts

Resolve this skill's `scripts/` directory once. Call its helpers rather than reimplementing
them. Tracker helpers use the nearest ancestor `.ai/sift` and its configured prefix;
`SIFT_ROOT` and `SIFT_PREFIX` override them.

```sh
scripts/wave-status.sh
scripts/next-ticket.sh --group   # optional cluster hint for planning a sitting
scripts/ticket-check.sh
scripts/reserve-ids.sh <count>
scripts/prepare-worktree.sh <base> <branch> <absolute-new-path>
scripts/drain-log.sh dispatch <TICKET>...
scripts/drain-log.sh return <TICKET> <STATUS>...
scripts/drain-log.sh report
```

Pass all tickets in a sitting to one dispatch or return call so they share a timestamp.
Workers stamp their own phases. `drain-log.sh` alone writes `RUNLOG.md`.
Use `find` and `command grep`, or no-ignore search, inside the usually ignored tracker.

## Wave graph

A sitting contains related tickets from one wave. Use several sittings when orientation
or write scope differs. Read [run-management.md](references/run-management.md) for intake,
overlap, worker reuse and check-back rules.

Repeat until no dispatchable work remains in this wave:

1. Before every dispatch, run `wave-status.sh` and read every remaining ticket it names.
   Rebuild the graph from the live tree. Dependencies and overlapping write scopes create
   sequential edges. Fill available agent slots with ready, non-overlapping sittings.
2. Prepare each branch and worktree using `prepare-worktree.sh` from the original
   repository. Pass the prepared worktree as `PROJECT_ROOT`, its branch, and the original
   project root as `SIFT_ROOT`. Keep the integration checkout for landings. Workers use
   absolute shared tracker paths; do not replace their `.ai/sift` with a symlink.
3. Stamp `drain-log.sh dispatch` immediately before dispatch. Use
   [ticket-agent-prompt.md](references/ticket-agent-prompt.md) verbatim with its placeholders
   resolved. Prefer a fresh task context containing the assignment over inherited history.
4. Choose the worker's model tier and reasoning effort from the work, not from the ticket's
   `effort` field, which measures size. Use the session's tier by default. Use a stronger
   tier and higher reasoning effort for difficult architecture, concurrency or verification.
   Bounded documentation or metadata tasks may use a cheaper tier with lower reasoning
   effort, explicit inputs and checks. Apply reasoning effort only where the harness exposes
   it. Honor user preferences.
5. On return, handle tamper first, then record each ticket's reported status with
   `drain-log.sh return`. For each done ticket, cherry-pick its commit with `-n`, set
   status, resolution and updated, then move it to the mirrored archive path. Land one
   commit per ticket containing implementation and tracker changes where tracked.
6. Assign every filed follow-up to this or a later wave. Run `ticket-check.sh` after your
   bookkeeping and fix any findings. Report one progress line per ticket and surface every
   self-filed ID. Rewire the graph and dispatch newly ready sittings.

**Failure policy:** retry only failed tickets once with their failure context. After a
second failure, set status blocked, keep the file under open with its wave, report it,
and continue. Preserve completed tickets from a partially successful sitting.

## Consume worker reports

[ticket-agent-prompt.md](references/ticket-agent-prompt.md) owns the exact report schema.
Validate reports before changing tracker state; ask the same worker for missing fields.
Its status and commit control landing, resolution supplies archive text and waived
coverage, and verification supports the progress update. Reserve IDs and file any
unfiled findings from issues before dispatching work that needs them.

## Wave gate

Use [wave-gate.md](references/wave-gate.md) for gate prompts and the closing report.
Prepare gate worktrees and branches as for implementation workers. Workers from the
wave do not continue into the gate or the next wave.

1. Dispatch the e2e specialist first and alone when an e2e layer can reach this wave's
   behavior. Otherwise record the skip reason. A skipped authoring pass does not remove
   the full e2e run when that layer exists.
2. Build batch coverage input from waived archived resolutions and deferred unsafe
   sequences. Dispatch the coverage agent next; it may also carry the full-suite close.
3. Land returned commits, then verify the integrated state with the full test, lint,
   static-analysis and applicable e2e suites. Record exact totals or no-e2e-layer status.
4. Group failures by root cause. Reserve IDs and file reported defects before dispatching
   their fixes. Land fix commits and repeat every full run after the last fix.
5. Work any remaining p1/p2 tickets filed into this wave before closing. Tickets inserted
   into an already closed wave become the current wave's tail; their deferred coverage
   belongs to the next gate. Do not reopen a closed gate.
6. When green, dispatch one knowledge-capture pass if reports contain durable candidates
   and the project has a capture skill. Land its commit and post the wave summary.

Continue into the next wave without a human pause.

## Final report at run end

Report wave state, blocked tickets and reasons, all filed tickets, and the timing table
from `drain-log.sh report`.
