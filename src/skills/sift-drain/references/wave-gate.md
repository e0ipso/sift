# Wave gate

Run the gate between waves in this order: e2e, batch coverage, root-cause fixes, knowledge
capture, close. The e2e specialist runs alone first; the batch agent may also run the close.

Prepare each agent's branch/worktree with prepare-worktree.sh. Substitute placeholders and
dispatch the selected fence verbatim. Each fence contains its agent's full ownership rules.

## 1. E2E specialist agent

Use a strong model. Skip authoring if no e2e layer exists or it cannot reach this wave's
behaviour; record why. An existing e2e suite still runs in full at close.

```
You are the e2e specialist closing Wave {{WAVE}} of the sift roadmap in {{PROJECT_ROOT}}.

Read project agent instructions, relevant knowledge entries and e2e conventions. Consult
manifests and CI config for missing commands. Verify every named path against the live tree.

WAVE {{WAVE}} SHIPPED:
{{PER_TICKET_ONE_LINE_SUMMARIES}}

TASK
Check which shipped behaviours the existing browser, API, CLI or lifecycle tests can reach.
Report each as covered or skipped, with a reason for every skip. Leave unreachable behaviour
to batch coverage.

Reuse helpers and fixtures, follow suite conventions and avoid duplicate assertions. Update
fixture setup for changed interfaces. Iterate on one test file, then run the full e2e suite.

Fix test-side failures. Report product defects with reproduction evidence and proposed scope.
The orchestrator creates tickets before dispatching annotations that need their IDs.

Do not capture durable knowledge. Do not edit the sift-drain skill. Never file, comment on, or
patch an external tracker. Report upstream proposals as type: dx defects for the orchestrator.

Use the prepared worktree at {{PROJECT_ROOT}} and its checked-out branch. Commit your scoped
changes and report the commit for integration into {{BASE_BRANCH}}. Do not create a branch
or check out the integration branch. Do not merge. Never `git push`. Do not write tracker
state, including ticket files, archive moves or wave keys.

REPORT (only this):
  status: done | blocked
  commit: <hash>
  summary: <one paragraph>
  verification: e2e <N passed / M failed / K skipped> across <e2e test files>
  behaviours covered: <one line each>
  behaviours skipped (no e2e surface): <one line each, with the reason>
  ticket-worthy defects: <one line each with evidence and proposed scope> | none
```

## 2. Batch coverage agent

Use a strong model. Populate {{WAIVED_CRITERIA}} from archived resolutions and reported
unsafe sequences. Do not add a fresh coverage audit.

```
You are the batch coverage agent closing Wave {{WAVE}} of the sift roadmap in
{{PROJECT_ROOT}}.

Read project agent instructions and relevant knowledge entries for test conventions and
verification commands. Consult manifests and CI config for missing details. Verify every
named path against the live tree.

WAVE {{WAVE}} SHIPPED:
{{PER_TICKET_ONE_LINE_SUMMARIES}}
{{WAIVED_CRITERIA}}

TASK
Cover the deferred criteria above. Prefer integration tests, unit tests for pure logic and
heavy e2e tests sparingly. Extend existing classes unless the subject is new. Test unsafe
sequences in disposable integration fixtures. Report each criterion covered or skipped with
a reason. Do not chase coverage percentages.

Run the full tests, authoritative lint/static analysis and any existing e2e suite. Report
exact totals for each, or explicitly report no e2e layer. All required runs must be green.

Fix test-side failures. Report product defects with evidence and proposed scope; do not fix
product code here. The orchestrator creates tickets before dispatching fixes or annotations
that need their IDs.

Do not capture durable knowledge. Do not edit the sift-drain skill. Never file, comment on, or
patch an external tracker. Report upstream proposals as type: dx defects for the orchestrator.

Use the prepared worktree at {{PROJECT_ROOT}} and its checked-out branch. Commit your scoped
changes and report the commit for integration into {{BASE_BRANCH}}. Do not create a branch
or check out the integration branch. Do not merge. Never `git push`. Do not write tracker
state, including ticket files, archive moves or wave keys.

REPORT (only this):
  status: done | blocked
  commit: <hash>
  summary: <one paragraph: what is now covered>
  verification: tests <N tests, M assertions> full suite; lint <result>; static analysis
                <result>; e2e <N passed / M failed / K skipped> | no e2e layer; tests
                added: <count and class names>
  deferred criteria: covered <list> | not covered <list and why>
  failures needing a fix agent: <root-cause list> | none
  ticket-worthy defects: <one line each with evidence and proposed scope> | none
```

## 3. Root-cause fixes

Assign one agent per root cause.

```
Fix one root cause of Wave {{WAVE}} gate fallout in {{PROJECT_ROOT}}.

ROOT CAUSE: {{ROOT_CAUSE_DESCRIPTION}}
FAILING: {{FAILING_TESTS_OR_SPECS}}

Read project agent instructions and relevant knowledge entries. Consult manifests and CI
config for missing verification commands. Verify every named path against the live tree.

Fix the root cause. Never weaken or delete assertions to pass tests. Explain and justify
corrections to wrong expectations. Extend existing tests without duplicating coverage.

Run scoped checks, then every full suite the cause touched and authoritative lint. Report
required checks that could not run and why. Report separate defects with evidence and scope
for the orchestrator to file and dispatch.

Do not capture durable knowledge. Do not edit the sift-drain skill. Never file, comment on, or
patch an external tracker. Report upstream proposals as type: dx defects for the orchestrator.

Use the prepared worktree at {{PROJECT_ROOT}} and its checked-out branch. Commit your scoped
changes and report the commit for integration into {{BASE_BRANCH}}. Do not create a branch
or check out the integration branch. Do not merge. Never `git push`. Do not write tracker
state, including ticket files, archive moves or wave keys.

REPORT (only this):
  status: done | blocked
  commit: <hash>
  summary: <one paragraph: the root cause and the fix>
  verification: <exact suite results>
  ticket-worthy defects: <one line each with evidence and proposed scope> | none
```

## 4. Wave knowledge capture

Run once after fixes land and the gate is green. Supply all worker reports, including
deferred knowledge. Skip if no durable candidates or capture skill exists; record why.

```
You are the knowledge-capture pass closing Wave {{WAVE}} of the sift roadmap in
{{PROJECT_ROOT}}. Every ticket of this wave has merged and the gate is green.

WAVE {{WAVE}} REPORTS (their `deferred to the wave gate:` lines name the candidates):
{{COLLECTED_SUB_AGENT_REPORTS}}

TASK
Read project agent instructions, the knowledge-base index and the capture skill in full.
Verify every named path, command and interface against the live tree before writing.

Capture durable conventions, gotchas and named things from the whole wave in one pass.
Omit ticket narration and facts superseded later in the wave. Resolve curation conflicts
conservatively using the live tree and newest user directives. Do not pause for user input.
Zero candidates is valid.

Never edit the sift-drain skill. Do not file, comment on, or patch an external tracker.
Report upstream proposals as type: dx candidates for the orchestrator.

Use the prepared worktree at {{PROJECT_ROOT}} and its checked-out branch. Commit your scoped
changes and report the commit for integration into {{BASE_BRANCH}}. Do not create a branch
or check out the integration branch. Do not merge. Never `git push`. Do not write tracker
state, including ticket files, archive moves or wave keys.

REPORT (only this):
  status: done | blocked
  commit: <hash>
  summary: <one paragraph: what the wave taught that outlives it>
  entries captured: <one line each> | none
  conflicts resolved: <older claim -> what the live tree says> | none
```

## 5. Closing the wave

After the last fix lands, rerun all full checks together; each fix agent checked only its
own affected suites. Require green results and exact totals. Apply the skill's p1/p2 and
closed-wave tail rules before closing.

Run `ticket-check.sh` (must exit 0), then post:

```
Wave {{WAVE}} closed.
  tickets done:    <IDs>
  tickets blocked: <IDs and one-line reasons> | none
  tickets filed:   <IDs and titles> | none
  tests added:     <classes/counts; e2e test files/counts>
  suite status:    tests <N, M assertions> green; e2e <N> green | no e2e layer; lint clean
  waves:           <wave-status.sh, summarised in one line>
```
