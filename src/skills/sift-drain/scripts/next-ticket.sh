# next-ticket.sh — print the next sift ticket to dispatch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/next-ticket.sh                 # next dispatchable ticket
#   scripts/next-ticket.sh --include-blocked
#   scripts/next-ticket.sh --group         # …plus its whole dispatch group
#   scripts/next-ticket.sh --include-blocked --   # -- ends the options
#
# Reads ticket front matter in dispatch order — `wave` ascending, then
# `priority` within the wave — and reports the first dispatchable open ticket
# plus selected front matter. The lookup state is `result: found|none`;
# `status:` remains the ticket's value and every report key is unique.
#
# `--group` adds same-cluster tickets within the count and effort bounds below,
# without changing the lead. `--` ends options; this command takes no operands.
#
# Exit codes: 0 found | 1 nothing left to dispatch | 2 setup/usage/consistency error.
