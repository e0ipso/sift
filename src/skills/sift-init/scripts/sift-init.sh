# sift-init: materialise a sift tree at an already-resolved root. Idempotent.
#
# Usage:
#   sift-init.sh --root PATH --prefix ABCD [--milestone NAME]
#   sift-init.sh --suggest-prefix --root PATH
#
# Options:
#   --root PATH        root already resolved by sift-gate.sh
#   --prefix ABCD      immutable ticket prefix
#   --milestone NAME   first milestone (default: backlog)
#   --suggest-prefix   print a derived prefix and write nothing
#   -h, --help         print this header
#
# Prefix suggestion strips non-alphanumerics from the root basename, uppercases
# it, and prints the first four characters. No usable suggestion exits 1 silently.
#
# Writes are create-if-absent. A repeat run repairs missing scaffolding without
# replacing repository content. Shipped README/schema drift is reported with
# explicit refresh commands; installed schemas no longer shipped are `orphan`.
#
# Output lists created, kept, stale, and orphan paths plus the selected prefix.
# Stale entries include explicit asset refresh commands. Orphan entries include
# a manual removal command. Neither condition rewrites an existing file.
#
# A final sift-gate check reports whether the resulting tree is READY.
#
# Reports are written to stdout; diagnostics are written to stderr.
# Exit codes:
#   0  created, repaired, or reported drift
#   1  no usable prefix suggestion
#   2  usage or environment error
# Deleting a possible repository-owned schema is the repair this script must never make on its own.
